# YOLOv8s-and-EfficientNetB0-for-teeth-age-classification
Automated dental age estimation from panoramic X-ray images using a two-stage deep learning framework. YOLOv8 is used for tooth detection and ROI extraction, followed by EfficientNet for chronological age regression. The model applies transfer learning and progressive fine-tuning, achieving 1.97 years MAE on ages 9–19.
